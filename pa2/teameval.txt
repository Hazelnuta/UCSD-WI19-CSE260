(3) Describe
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
        because there is only one person in my team, I do the all tasks.
  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
        Yes, I completed the assignment
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
      because there is only one person in my team, I don't have to discuss with other people.
      due to that, I can do this assignment more efficiently.
  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
        I learned how to utilize GPU and how to take advantage of the different kinds of memory in GPU.
  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
        nothing to change.
